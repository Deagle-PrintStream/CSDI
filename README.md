# CSDI

Forked from orignal  "[CSDI: Conditional Score-based Diffusion Models for Probabilistic Time Series Imputation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03502)". Somehow I messed up with `git clone` operation due to network problems, so I had to download orignal source files as zip and upload manually.

## Tasks

1. data visualization of [physio dataset](https://physionet.org/files/challenge-2012/1.0.0/set-a)
2. minor code optimizations in kernel modules
3. parameter optimizations for better performance upon physio dataset
4. algorithm improvement (seems a bit hard?)
